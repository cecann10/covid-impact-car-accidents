#### PROJECT PROPOSAL:

### COVID’S EFFECT ON CAR ACCIDENTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES
#### An examination of if incidents and severity of car accidents in the US has been affected by changes in traffic as states have implements shelter-in-place regulations related to COVID in 2020



**Background:**</br>
On average, the United States has ~36k fatalities per year from vehicle accidents.   There are behavioral actions that are associated with accidents -- e.g. not wearing a seatbelt, speeding, texting, etc -- but there are also external factors, such as weather, temperature, geography, whether at an intersection, that can play a part in propensity for an accident to occur.

With the spread of COVID and cities and states ‘locking down’ across the country, this brings in a new external factor to consider.  While COVID has had countless negative effects on the world, but during the height of stay-at-home orders by states there were reports of less cars on the road leading to cleaner air, clearer views, and more recreation; glimmers of unintended positive impacts.  Could COVID also be associated with fewer and/or less severe accidents?


**Project Objectives:**</br>
1. Identify what ‘evergreen’ external factors (geography, time of day, wind speed, temperature, traffic signals in the area, etc.) have a relationship with the severity of an accident and use them to predict future accidents.
2. Determine if the ‘new’ external factor of the COVID-related lockdown rules slowed traffic in states has a relationship with the severity of an accident.
3. Determine if COVID-related lockdown rules reduced frequency of accidents in general, looking state by state as their rules varied across the nation.

**Project Approach:**</br>
To reach this project’s objectives, this project will use traffic data on car accidents from February 2016 to June 2020 across the US (~3.5M accidents) and combine it with data on when states (if ever) implemented stay-at-home orders for citizens and then also when they (if yet) reopened the state.

Multi-classification models will be used to determine if the severity of an accident can be predicted with an understanding of the evergreen external factors, and then also look at the period of COVID across states to see how it may have affected frequency and/or severity of accidents.
